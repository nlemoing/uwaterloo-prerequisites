# uwaterloo-prerequisites
Parses the UWaterloo courses page to find prerequisites for courses at Waterloo. 

This module uses BeautifulSoup to find and parse the prerequisites for all courses at the University of Waterloo.
Once found, prerequisites can be checked against a course schedule to check if a course's requirements are being met.

Prerequisites can also be put into a tree structure. This recursively finds dependencies for a specific course.
This can be done using the "Tree" class.

This is my first project with Python! I'm used to programming in C/C++ so this has been a lot of fun.
